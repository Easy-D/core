/**
 * A market is an instance of an options contract market.
 * A single market represents a specific option definition with a token pair, expiration, and strike price.
 * A market has 3 states:
 * 0) OPEN - The options contract is open and new option tokens can be minted.  Holders of bTokens can exercise the tokens for collateral with payment.
 * 1) EXPIRED - The options contract cannot mint any new options.  bTokens cannot be exercised.  wTokens can redeem collateral and any payments.
 * 2) CLOSED - 180 days after expiration the Market enters the terminal CLOSED state, in this state the Market can only sweep leftover tokens to the owner, or destroy itself
 * All parameters must be set by the Initialize function before the option market is live.
 *
 * This contract is ownable.  By default, the address that deployed it will be the owner.
